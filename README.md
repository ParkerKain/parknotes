# Welcome to `parknotes`!

`parknotes` is a project that serves a couple purposes for me: 

* Be a landing point for todos and note taking via markdown files and neovim, which I use in my personal life and work.
* Have a good reason to learn Rust and start to practice it on a real project!

This project is far from done and even farther from clean. Furthermore, the project is not yet ready for use outside of my own machine, but I intend to make this an instalble crate once it's in a good place!
